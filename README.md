  # Local Farmers Marketplace Prototype

  This is a code bundle for Local Farmers Marketplace Prototype. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/AD77NlTSXnozalJFXsqkIs/Local-Farmers-Marketplace-Prototype.

  ## Running the code

  Frontend Setup:

  Open a terminal in the main project directory
  Run npm i to install the dependencies
  Run npm run dev to start the development server

  Backend Setup:

  Open a second terminal and navigate to the backend folder: cd backend
  Run npm i to install backend dependencies
  Run npm start or node server.js to start the backend server

  Note: Both terminals must remain open for the application to function properly - the frontend connects to the backend API for all data operations.
